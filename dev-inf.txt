How to upload local files to server:
	Paste all files of the repository, except .git folder, to win-scp. Don't copy files from win-scp to your pc. Always pull files from GitHub.


How to test your changes:
	Step 1:
		Upload local files to server (see above)
	Step 2:
		If everything works, commit and push (see above).

		If it does not work, do git stash to temporarily "hide" your changes. You should now have the original files.
		Upload these original files to the server (so you leave everything as it was before). If you created any new files, delete them from the server.
		Do git stash apply, to get back your changes and continue working on them.

		Note: Sometimes, you need to wait a little for the server to apply your changes
